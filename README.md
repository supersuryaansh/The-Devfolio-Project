**Largest ever data set of Devfolio hackathons, sponsors, projects and much more. Scraped from 60K+ Devfolio pages and hackathons.**  

![Epic dataset of Devfolio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fbc4999-2979-4813-b226-7f863a215e6e)

    
### Data set date: 21 July 2024    
 The data set is huge. The Raw Datasets folder has two files: one with all **external links** and another with **Internal links**.    
    
For specific use cases, this needs filtering and cleaning.    
  
## Use Cases:  
  
 1. Finding sponsors  
 2. Building AI tools to find sponsors  
 3. Exploring Projects being built on Devfolio  
 4. Analysing patterns in Projects  
 5. Tech trends among participants  
 6. Whatever you can think of......  
  
## About Datasets:
1. raw/ External Links => Contains all Links that go outside of Devolio, includes projects, sponsors etc..
2. raw/ Internal Links => Contains all Devfolio internal links such as devfolio hackathons etc..
3. raw/ Site Structure => Has a lot of data specific to Devfolio structure along with user profiles and description.    What would you do with it? IDK!
